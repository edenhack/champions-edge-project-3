# Project 3

* React.js / Vue / Angular
* League of Legends API
* Data Dragon LoL assets
* MySQL Database

## Proposal

~ There are countless well known websites that utilize the LoL api to send you data related to pre-game lobby matchups and suggested builds for a matchup. But none that do both at the same time. My project is an attempt to combine these features into a singular source for users to utilize and help them adapt their gameplay based on the team compositions, their enemy team win rates with champions and other statistics to give them the best edge against their opponents.

This project will utilize react/vue/ or angular for the front end. With a database on the backend server to contain and update data from the LoL API. This data will dynamically be viewable and searchable based on summonerID which is part of the LoL API.

I will be using an outside grandmaster player's assistance to develop this application in a way that he feels matches the needs of players currently and utilize his experience with the other applications to build something pro-actively different as well as inventive that stands out against the competition.

### Database

Expected database needs are unkown currently as I need to research the LoL API and what all is able to be dynamically pulled from their servers instead of retaining it on my own database considering the massive quantity of data that will be needed.

Based on possible needs for heavy relation based data, if database is needed it will be MySQL based.
